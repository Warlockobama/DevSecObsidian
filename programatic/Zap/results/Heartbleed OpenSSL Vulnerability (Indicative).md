# Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability (Indicative)

**ID:** 10034
**Risk Level:** Not specified
**CWE ID:** Not specified
**WASC ID:** Not specified
**Attack Strength:** Not specified
**Alert Threshold:** DEFAULT

## Rule Description
The TLS and DTLS implementations in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g do not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

## Solution
Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later. Re-issue HTTPS certificates. Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised, with no evidence of compromise in the server log files.
