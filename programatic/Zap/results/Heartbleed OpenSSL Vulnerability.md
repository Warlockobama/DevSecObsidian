# Heartbleed OpenSSL Vulnerability

**ID:** 20015
**Risk Level:** High
**CWE ID:** 119
**WASC ID:** 20
**Attack Strength:** DEFAULT
**Alert Threshold:** DEFAULT

## Rule Description
The TLS implementation in OpenSSL 1.0.1 before 1.0.1g does not properly handle Heartbeat Extension packets, which allows remote attackers to obtain sensitive information from process memory via crafted packets that trigger a buffer over-read, potentially disclosing sensitive information.

## Solution
Update to OpenSSL 1.0.1g or later. Re-issue HTTPS certificates. Change asymmetric private keys and shared secret keys, since these may have been compromised, with no evidence of compromise in the server log files.
